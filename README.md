# In Progress Material UI Blog theme

The theme is mostly baked, just need to add a few more documentation pieces to make it easier for you to use :).

Docs and readme updated soon - first testing my npm publish skillz.

*Note:*

The theme should be working overall, you can pass in custom site-metadata options to configure to your needs.

I'm working on getting the component shadowing working with the Gatsby team -- starter with examples will be linked here soon!
