## Use the Starter

Interested in using the blog theme? I've created a gatsby starter for you! [gatsby-starter-ggt-material-ui-blog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@greatgatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-ggt-material-ui-blog)


The starter documentation shows the theme options and explains component shadowing in more detail.
